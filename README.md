- Important LINUX Commands
  - cd : It is used to change the current working directory.
  - ls : It lists the contents of a directory.
  - ls -ltr : It lists the contents of a directory in long format, sorted by modification time in reverse order (oldest first).
  - ls --help: It displays a help message with a list of options and usage information for the "ls" command.
     Note : You can give any command name and then type "--help" to get info about that command.
  - clear: It clears the terminal screen.
 

Now, we go to the  work directory where all files related to the workshop are stored
```
cd Desktop
```
```
cd work/tools/
```
